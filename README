Driver Saitek Radio Panel for flightgear under Linux

This program requires that shared library 'libudev1' is installed. On Ubuntu,
'sudo apt install libudev1' would do the trick

###Â 
copy saitek_input.xml and saitek_output.xml to $FG_ROOT/Protocol
copy Saitek.nas  to ~/.fgfs/Nasal/
Scripts 'movenas' and 'movexml' will do this for you
If the radio panel produces mouse commands, run the script 'stripper'
which should eliminate the problem (This on Ubuntu 18.04.4 Bionic)

##
 run flightgear with options : 

/usr/games/fgfs \
	...
	--generic=socket,out,30,127.0.0.1,49001,udp,saitek_output \
	--generic=socket,in,30,,49002,udp,saitek_input \
	...


## run driver - you will be asked to operate a control on the radio panel
	./SaitekRadioPanel

The complete Eclipse project is also provided in 'EclipseSaitekRadioPanel.tgz'

I (Dave Attwood 2020 dave@attwoods.org.uk) would like to acknowledge and was inspired by an 
original version of this software (Halim DJERROUD 2016 hdd@ai.univ-paris8.fr) of which a few
fragments remain.
