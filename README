I (Dave Attwood 2020 dave@attwoods.org.uk) would like to acknowledge and was inspired by an 
original version of this software (Halim DJERROUD 2016 hdd@ai.univ-paris8.fr) of which a few
fragments remain. Robert Feal-Martinez inspired, tested (and contributed to) the development of the
Raspberry Pi version.

For problems or issues either enter an issue on Github, or email stkrp@attwoods.org.uk.
