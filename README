DRIVER FOR SAITEK RADIO PANEL
=============================

Two versions of the driver are provided:
   1. Linux with or without using libudev
   2. Raspberry Pi, probably for use with Windows
   
To install this product on Linux, follow the instructions in INSTALL.

For Windows, copy the download the file Raspberry.zip to your
machine, unzip and follow the instructions given in the zip file.

For Linux:

##

	...
	--generic=socket,out,30,127.0.0.1,49001,udp,saitek_output 
	--generic=socket,in,30,,49002,udp,saitek_input 
	...


## run driver - you will be asked to operate a control on the radio panel
	StartPanel


If the radio panel produces mouse commands, run 'demouseify'
which should eliminate the problem (This on Ubuntu 18.04.4 Bionic)
The complete source code is also provided, but not required for installation

I (Dave Attwood 2020 dave@attwoods.org.uk) would like to acknowledge and was inspired by an 
original version of this software (Halim DJERROUD 2016 hdd@ai.univ-paris8.fr) of which a few
fragments remain. Robert Feal-Martinez inspired, tested (and contributed to) the development of the
Raspberry Pi version.

For problems or issues either enter an issue on Github, or email stkrp@attwoods.org.uk.
