INSTALLATION
============

If installing without libudev, determine the device address of the Radio Panel, it's
probably /dev/hidraw2.

Type:
	./configure
	make
	sudo make install

If the Radio Panel is plugged in, disconnect and reconnect it to change the access
permissions.

The driver can then be started with the command 'StartPanel'
